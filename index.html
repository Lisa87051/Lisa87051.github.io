    <h3 align="center">Iceland</h3>
    <p><strong><i>Iceland</strong></i> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice co-exist. Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture. </p>

    </figure>The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman godess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.<br>The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic fiel. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks accross the skies.</p>

    </figure>When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake-namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year round and takes place mainly on the S&oacute;lheimaj&ouml;kull and Sv&iacute;nafellsj&ouml;kull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafell)</p>
